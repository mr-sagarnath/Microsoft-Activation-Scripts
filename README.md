Note

The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.
Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.
To run the scripts in unattended mode, check here.
